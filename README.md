This nifty litte script casts an empty onto any geometry the scene camera is pointed towards. You can then use the empty as a driver for the scene camera's focus/depth of field. The empty's position updates every frame.

1. Copy the code in the ray_cast_empty.py file and paste it into the Blender text editor.
2. Make sure there is camera in the scene, and that its center is pointing towards an object.
3. Run the code.
4. Move the keyframe handle in the timeline a few frames forward. An empty should appear and stick itself onto the surface of whatever geometry is infront of the camera.
